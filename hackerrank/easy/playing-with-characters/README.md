# Playing With Characters

## Problem

**Objective**

This challenge will help you to learn how to take a character, a string and a sentence as input in C. 

To take a single character $ch$ as input, you can use `scanf("%c", &ch );` and `printf("%c", ch)` writes a character specified by the argument char to stdout

```c
char ch;
scanf("%c", &ch);
printf("%c", ch);
```
This piece of code prints the character $ch$.

You can take a string as input in C using `scanf(“%s”, s)`. But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.   

In order to take a line as input, you can use `scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s);` where  $s$ is defined as `char s[MAX_LEN]` where $MAX\_LEN$ is the maximum size of $s$. Here, ``[]`` is the scanset character. `^\n` stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. Then, with this `%*c`, it reads the newline character and here, the used ``*`` indicates that this newline character is discarded.

**Note:** The statement: `scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s);` will not work because the last statement will read a newline character, `\n`, from the previous line. This can be handled in a variety of ways.  One way is to use `scanf("\n");` before the last statement.  

**Task**

You have to print the character, $ch$, in the first line. Then print $s$ in  next line. In the last line print the sentence, $sen$.


**Input Format**

First, take a character, $ch$ as input.  
Then take the string, $s$ as input.  
Lastly, take the sentence $sen$ as input.

**Constraints**

Strings for $s$ and $sen$ will have fewer than 100 characters, including the newline.   

**Output Format**

Print three lines of output. The first line prints the character, $ch$.  
The second line prints the string, $s$.  
The third line prints the sentence, $sen$.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{

    char ch;
    char s[100];
    char sentence[100];

    scanf("%c", &ch);
    scanf("%s", s);
    scanf(" %[^\n]", sentence);

    printf("%c\n", ch);
    printf("%s\n", s);
    printf("%s\n", sentence);

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    return 0;
}

```
